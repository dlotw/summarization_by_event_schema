It will be difficult for Congress to sell restored or additional spending on current poverty programs when the American people are already spending more than $ 100 billion a year on these programs .All the important players -- the president , the governors and congressional leaders -- agree that the goal of such reform is to transform the welfare system into one that enables poor families to achieve , in the president 's words , `` real and lasting emancipation '' from welfare dependency .The bill proposes $ 5.2 billion in new spending over five years , and most of that will increase benefits currently received by welfare recipients .The House bill , with training and education programs as well as health and child-care benefits , would make welfare parents who work better off than those who do not , said Downey , acting chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on public assistance and unemployment compensation .At the least , welfare reform should have these goals : to shrink rather than enlarge the welfare system , to ultimately eliminate perverse incentives to remain on welfare , and to make work the focus of the system .
