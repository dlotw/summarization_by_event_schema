Patrick Leahy , D-Vt. , said `` in the past few months alone the Supreme Court is throwing out past decisions , and I think it is legitimate to ask Judge Thomas, what do you think of settled law , like Roe vs. Wade ( legitimatizing abortion ) , what do you think of a woman 's right to privacy , free speech issues , issues of freedom of religion .; `` The background of Judge Clarence Thomas is less important than his views and what they mean to protecting our constitutional rights , '' said Sen. Paul Simon , D-Ill. ; When head of the EEOC during the Reagan administration , Thomas `` seemed to go out of his way to find ways to weaken some of the basic civil rights protections , '' said Simon , a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee .'' While the views of President Bush 's first Supreme Court nominee , David Souter , were virtually unknown before his confirmation , the 43-year-old Mr. Thomas has boldly articulated his vision of constitutional law , both as a judge -- he now sits on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit , the nation 's second-highest bench -- and, before that , as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for eight years .
