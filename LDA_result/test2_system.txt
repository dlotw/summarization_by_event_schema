Recently the fascination has taken on a more anxious cast as the disease has struck humans and animals with suspicious regularity in several places, underscoring a longstanding question : Do people get the disease from animals ? The question has burned with special intensity since scrapie , the form of the disease in sheep , jumped to British cattle a few years ago after they were fed ground-up parts of infected sheep .If the disease has jumped from sheep to cattle -- and cases have also been reported in kudu antelope at London Zoo -- could it affect humans ? That prospect , discounted by most scientists -- including MAFF critics such as Mr Purdey -- is considered a possibility by Richard Lacey , a Leeds University microbiologist who has been studying cases of CJD , a disease with a long incubation period .Several German scientists have expressed concern that BSE - popularly known as 'mad cow disease ' because of the way it debilitates the brains of cattle -may be transmissible to humans who eat contaminated beef or take medicines made with ingredients from contaminated animals .The UK will get strong backing from Brussels today when Germany seeks a ban on British beef exports because of fear of 'mad cow disease ' , or bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) .
