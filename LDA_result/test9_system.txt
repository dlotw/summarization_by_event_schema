They attribute the 5 percent national increase in TB cases in 1989 to the ravages of the AIDS virus , which destroys the body 's immune system and leaves victims open to TB infection , Dr. Philip C. Hopewell of San Francisco General Hospital said Sunday .In the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the TB usually resulted from activation of lingering tuberculosis infections , not new exposures to the bacteria , in people who also are infected with the AIDS virus .While most people with the AIDS virus eventually go on to get acquired immune deficiency syndrome, people who carry the tuberculosis bacteria ordinarily have only about a 10 percent life-long risk of getting TB .Snider said 10 million to 15 million Americans have been infected with the tuberculosis germ , but only a small percentage of them develop the disease because their immune system was strong enough to prevent the disease from developing .Tuberculosis was down 8.7 percent among whites in 1988 , as compared with 1985 , but up 9.1 percent among blacks and 17.6 percent among Hispanics _ two groups with proportionately higher rates of AIDS cases .If , however , a person 's immune system is impaired by poor nutrition or weakened by the HIV virus , people can develop active TB .
