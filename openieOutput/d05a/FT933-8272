Robert Will of Edinburgh's Western General Hospital, who has been monitoring CJD in the UK since 1990 on behalf of the health department, calculated that there was only a five per cent probability of even a single case occurring by chance among dairy farmers with BSE-affected herds.

One argument put forward by the health department is that CJD has such a long incubation period - typically 10 to 20 years - that clinical symptoms would not yet have appeared, even if BSE had triggered any cases of CJD.

Another reassuring argument is that both farmers showed clinical features typical of the 'sporadic form' of CJD - of unknown cause - that usually occurs in late middle age.

The second annual report of Will's National CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh, published last month, shows what looks at first sight like a disturbing rise in incidence: from 32 UK cases in the year ended April 1991 to 37 in 1991/92 and 46 in 1992/3.

Scientists trying to understand the epidemic face an unusual problem: BSE, scrapie and CJD are caused by a bizarre, infectious agent, the prion, which does not follow the normal rules of microbiology.

Once in place in the victim's brain, it catalyses what John Collinge, a prion researcher at St Mary's Hospital Medical School, London, called a slow 'chemical chain reaction', converting the normal protein into its own abnormal form.
