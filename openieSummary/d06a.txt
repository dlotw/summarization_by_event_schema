Jackson said he chose Long Beach police because of complaints to the Police Misconduct Lawyer's Referral Service of Los Angeles. Investigations have been launched by the FBI, the Los Angeles County district  attorney's office and the Long Beach Police Department. The offending officer's police report indicated that the suspect's injuries were due to a fall from his bike and that he appeared unconscious, although he had also struggled against being handcuffed.; ``I ... do not support racism or police brutality, nor do the vast majority of the citizens of Long Beach, and we're a caring, thinking community and it disturbed us very much to see the tape,'' he said. The spotlight that had been trained on the police department and its 8,300 officers now has widened to take in the equally large sheriff's department. At the City Council hearings Thursday and Friday, blacks who alleged they were the victims of police brutality accused officers _ most of them white _ of unprovoked beatings, false arrests, intimidation and insulting them with racial slurs. A white Long Beach police officer who allegedly pushed a black man through a  plate-glass window during an arrest that was secretly videotaped by a  television crew acknowledged Friday that he made errors in his official report.
