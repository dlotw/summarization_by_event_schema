In his State of the Union address last January, President Reagan announced that welfare reform would be a priority of his administration in its final three years. ``I will not accept any welfare reform bill unless it is geared to making people independent of welfare.'' ``Any bill not built around work is not true welfare reform,'' the president said. Measures such as these would fundamentally change the nature of the welfare state, however. Many states have already embarked on far-reaching welfare reform programmes, such as Michigan's 21-point plan to strengthen families or New Jersey's family development programme. In fact, while the level of AFDC benefits has decreased in real terms since 1970, the total level of all welfare benefits has not. They would require all able-bodied welfare recipients (except mothers with children under 3 years of age) to work in exchange for their benefits. PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday promised to name a task-force within the next 10 days to reform the US social safety net of welfare programmes. Advocates of welfare reform had been discouraged about the new administration's intentions, fearing that the centrist Democratic emphasis on requiring welfare recipients to work or enroll for training might fall prey to left-wing advocacy groups concentrating on greater funding of existing programmes.
