Tuberculosis is alarming health officials again because it's posing new health threats with its connection to the AIDS virus. The study suggests that it lowers resistance to the tuberculosis bacteria, putting people at much higher risk of TB. People may carry either the AIDS virus or tuberculosis bacteria for many years without getting sick. The CDC's Advisory Committee for the Elimination of Tuberculosis is recommending TB testing for most new prison inmates and staff members _ with the possible exception of inmates just transferring through for less than a week. Another soon-to-be published study reports the discovery of a racial difference in the way blood cells respond to the TB bacteria, which could help explain why blacks seem to be more prone to tuberculosis. A steady decline in tuberculosis has all but stopped amid the continuing threat of TB for the AIDS-infected, federal health researchers say. However, he noted that there had been an increase in positive TB tests among AIDS health workers. There are about 8 million new cases of tuberculosis a year, according to the  U.N. agency. About 4 percent of Americans identified as having the AIDS virus also have been diagnosed as being infected with tuberculosis, said Dr. Dixie E. Snider Jr., director of the division of tuberculosis control at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
