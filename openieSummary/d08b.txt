Also, its 150-mile-wide path across Hawaii, Baja California, Mexico City and four Central American capital cities "puts more people in the moon's shadow than any other eclipse in history," says Alan Dyer, an editor of Astronomy magazine.; In Helsinki, the total eclipse phase will occur 16 minutes after sunrise, when the sun is only 1 degree above the horizon. It will be the last chance to see a total solar eclipse this century. The eclipse will be seen from Hawaii to central Brazil. The eclipse will last the longest -- six minutes and 58 seconds -- at the center of the shadow in the town of Tuxpan, on Mexico's west coast. After the total phase of the eclipse, the moon will move away, uncovering more and more of the sun. Scientists will conduct several experiments during the eclipse, including gravity test measurements of the radius of the sun. The Bay Area gets cheated and will see the moon block only about half the sun's diameter.; The world will not see such a long-lasting eclipse for another 151 years.;
