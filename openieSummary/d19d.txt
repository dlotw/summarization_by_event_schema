In a blow to California and other states with large immigrant populations, the  Senate voted Friday to bar the Census Bureau from counting illegal aliens in  the 1990 population count. In a blow to California and other states with large immigrant populations, the  Senate voted Friday to bar the Census Bureau from counting illegal aliens in  the 1990 population count. Before Thursday's action, the Senate had voted to bar the Census Bureau from  counting illegal aliens, although the House had twice rejected efforts to  exclude aliens. ``Every census since the Constitution was adopted has counted all residents of the states, including both legal and illegal aliens,'' added Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif. Just Thursday, efforts to include illegal aliens in the Census received a major  boost when negotiators from the U.S. Senate and House agreed on the issue. The Census Bureau's $4 billion budget for the census is large enough to identify and separate out the illegal aliens, he said. The director of the county Social Services Agency wants all Orange County  residents, including illegal aliens, to be counted in the 1990 Census, and he  will ask the Board of Supervisors to support his position.
