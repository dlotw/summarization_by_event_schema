Two U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter
jets crashed in the air today and exploded , an air force
spokeswoman said . The accident occurred less than two hours after
another F-16 crashed into the Black Forest .
West German police said one pilot was killed in the in-flight
crash .
The Air Force spokeswoman , Capt . Gail Hayes , said the aircraft
were on a training mission when they crashed near Bodenheim , about
six miles south of Mainz .
She said the aircraft , assigned to the 50th Tactical Fighter
Wing at Hahn Air Base , crashed at 1:30 p.m .
`` There was one person aboard each aircraft . The condition of
those on board is unknown , '' Ms. Hayes told The Associated Press in
a telephone interview from U.S. Air Force European headquarters at
Ramstein Air Base .
West German police spokesman Hugo Lenxweiler told the AP in a
telephone interview that one of the pilots was killed in the
accident .
`` The other pilot was able to eject safely , '' Lenxweiler said .
Lenxweiler said he did not know if the pilot who ejected
suffered any injuries . Identities of the pilots were not
immediately released . He said the planes crashed within several
hundred yards of a populated area but that no one on the ground was
hurt .
He said preliminary information indicated that one of the F-16s
rammed the other from behind . Both planes exploded on impact , he
said .
The other crash occurred about 90 miles away .
Air Force Spokesman 1st Lt. Al Sattler said the pilot in the
Black Forest crash ejected safely before the crash and was taken to
Ramstein Air Base to be examined .
Police in Karlsruhe said the crash occurred at noon ( 6 a.m. EDT )
near the village of Marxzell-Burbach .
Sattler said the aircraft was from the 52nd Tactical Fighter
Wing , stationed at Spangdahlen Air Base .
The aircraft was taking part in a NATO military tactical air
exercise being conducted from the Canadian air force base in
Baden-Soellingen , Sattler said .
West German police and U.S. military personnel secured the area
of the crashes , and teams of experts were sent to the accident
sites to determine the cause of the crashes .
A U.S. military jet crashed today in a remote,
forested area in northern Japan , but the pilot bailed out safely
and was taken by helicopter to an American military base , officials
said .
The pilot of the F-16C , Maj. Wyman E. Vanedoe , was listed in
good condition soon after the crash , the U.S . Forces Japan Media
Liaison Office in Tokyo said . Vanedoe 's home town was not
immediately available , said a U.S. official who spoke on condition
of anonymity .
Isao Teranagare , spokesman of Iwate Prefecture ( state ) Police,
said the pilot was taken by a Japanese rescue helicopter to the
U.S. Air Base at Misawa in northern Japan .
No one else was aboard the fighter , he said .
The U.S. aircraft , belonging to the 14th Tactical Fighter
Squadron at Misawa , was on a routine training flight with two other
F-16s in partly cloudy skies when it crashed in a forested area in
Iwate , police said .
Iwate is about 290 miles north of Tokyo .
The cause of the crash was under investigation .
On March 22 , 1987 , another F-16 crashed in the Pacific Ocean off
Misawa , 360 miles north of Tokyo . In that crash , the pilot also
bailed out and was rescued by a helicopter .
The F-16 , a powerful air-to-surface fighter , has a combat range
of about 575 miles , according to Jane 's `` All The World 's
Aircraft . ''
About 50 F-16s are stationed at Misawa . Misawa is located about
440 miles south of a Soviet military base near Yuzhno Sakhalinsk on
the island of Sakhalin .
Coast Guard and Navy aircraft and vessels today searched for a
crewman missing from an F-14 jet fighter that plunged into the
Atlantic Ocean off North Carolina while practicing combat
maneuvers , killing his crewmate , officials said .
Six people were injured in another F-14 crash Monday after two
Navy aviators bailed out of their jet over an airfield in the San
Diego suburb of El Cajon , sending it smashing into a hangar . And a
pilot in Utah escaped injury today in a third military training
flight in two days .
The crash off Hatteras , N.C. , occurred Monday afternoon 22 miles
east of Oregon Inlet , the Navy said . A fishing boat picked up a
crewman , who was pronounced dead .
The identity of the dead aviator and his missing crewmate were
not released pending notification of relatives .
Five people , including the two Navy fliers , remained
hospitalized today following the crash Monday morning in El Cajon
15 miles east of San Diego .
The $ 35 million jet crashed upside down into hangars at
Gillespie Field and exploded . The blaze ignited by the crash
destroyed a hangar and an attached extension , but spared a nearby
restaurant .
Authorities said the two crewman tried to guide the jet to the
runway at Gillespie Field before bailing out .
Capt . Gary Hughes , commanding officer of Naval Air Station
Miramar , said he was grateful there were n't more injuries,
`` particularly when you 're this close to El Cajon . It 's a very
populated area . ''
The jet passed within a mile of an elementary school .
`` I thought they were just doing tricks . And then we saw the
parachutes , '' said Washington Moscuso , a sixth-grader at Ballantyne
Elementary School .
In the Atlantic accident , Lt. Cmdr . Mike John , a spokesman for
the Navy 's Atlantic Fleet air force in Norfolk , Va. , said the plane
was engaged in mock dogfights with another F-14 and an A-4 jet in
restricted military airspace off the North Carolina coast .
`` It was flying a routine training mission , '' John said .
The cause of the crash was not determined , officials said . The
aircraft sank soon after impact , John said .
The twin-engine supersonic fighter was attached to Fighter
Squadron 143 at Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia Beach , Va .
In northern Utah today , an F-16A jet fighter crashed west of
Hill Air Force Base after the pilot bailed out , a base spokeswoman
said . The aircraft , assigned to Hill 's 388th Tactical Fighter Wing,
was on a routine training mission .
Spokeswoman Silvia Le Mons-Liddle said the plane went down about
25 miles west of the base about 9:05 a.m. MDT . She said the crash
site was in or near the Promontory Mountains , which are on a
peninsula jutting into the Great Salt Lake , but she declined to be
more specific .
A B-52 bomber crashed and burst into
flames early today on a runway while practicing `` touch-and-go ''
landings at K.I . Sawyer Air Force Base , officials said . All eight
crew members survived .
The plane , normally equipped to carry nuclear bombs , crashed
about 1:15 a.m. , said Lt. Naomi Siegal , a spokeswoman at the
Strategic Air Command installation .
No weapons were aboard , said Lt. Col. George Peck , a spokesman
for SAC headquarters in Omaha , Neb .
The crew was practicing landings after a seven-hour training
flight when it crashed during one of its touch-and-go approaches,
Peck said . During such maneuvers , landing gears touch the ground but
the plane does n't land .
All three sections of the plane burned on impact , said Senior
Airman Tim Sanders , a base spokesman . The crew members crawled or
were helped out of the front section of the aircraft , he said . They
were taken to Marquette General and base hospitals .
Members of the crew suffered broken bones , but no one was burned,
said Capt . Paul Bicking , another Sawyer spokesman .
Senior Airman Tim Sanders , another base spokesman , said those
aboard were Capt . Mark Hartney , 29 , an aircraft commander from
Mulberry , Fla. ; 1st Lt. Michael S. Debruzzi , 26 , a pilot from New
Brighton , Minn. ; Capt . Anthony D. Phillips , 28 , a radar navigator
from Folkston , Ga. ; 1st Lt. James W. Herrmann , 30 , a navigator from
Sharpsville , Pa. ; 1st Lt. Daniel McCarrick , 25 , an electronic
warfare officer from Succasunna , N.J. ; Airman 1st Class , Joseph A .
Vallie , 20 , a gunner from Stephenson , Mich. ; Maj. William R .
Kroeger , 52 , an instructor pilot from Fountain Hills , Ariz. ; and 1st
Lt. Gregory C. Smith , 26 , an upgrade pilot from Henning , Minn. All
were based at Sawyer .
Ann Parent , a spokeswoman for Marquette General Hospital , said
Hartney and Debruzzi were in fair condition , Phillips and Vallie
were in stable condition , McCarrick was in satisfactory condition
and Kroeger was in serious condition .
Herrmann and Smith were listed in stable condition at the base
hospital , said Technical Sgt . Anita Bailey .
Hartney was the aircraft commander , but Debruzzi also was
qualified to fly the plane , Bailey said . She did not know who was at
the controls at the time of the crash .
`` We are counting our blessings , '' Bailey said . `` You can put
parts of a plane back together , but you can not put people back
together . ''
The accident was classified as the most serious kind , and all
aircraft exercises at Sawyer were canceled even though runways other
than the one where the crash occurred remained open , Bailey said .
Peck said a board of officers will investigate the accident,
adding weather did not appear to be a factor in the crash .
Peck said it was not unusual for B-52 training missions to be out
at that hour .
`` Crews have to be trained to fly at any time of the day or night
in any weather , '' he said .
The eight-engine B-52 , which was deployed in the early 1950s , is
the military 's biggest bomber , with a wingspan of 185 feet and a
maximum takeoff weight of 488,000 pounds . The last B-52 was
commissioned in 1962 .
In other accidents involving B-52s , a bomber was damaged when a
pilot aborted a takeoff and overshot a runway at Castle Air Force
Base in central California on Feb. 11 . No one was injured .
A B-52 bomber with radar problems crashed in Arizona'a Monument
Valley in October 1984 , killing two crew members , after its wings
clipped a mesa .
The Air Force has had more trouble recently with the B-52 's
successor , the B-1B bomber . Although smaller than the B-52 , the B-1B
can fly at supersonic speeds and carry more bombs .
Four B-1Bs have crashed in the four years the plane has been
flying , including two nine days apart in November . One of the $ 280
million B-1Bs was destroyed after smashing onto a runway at
Ellsworth Air Force Base , S.D. , during a training flight on Nov. 17 .
On Nov. 8 , a B-1B crashed and burned in a field near Dyess Air Force
Base , Texas .
No one was killed in either crash and investigators have not
disclosed what caused the accidents .
Six crewmen died and 10 were injured Oct. 11 when an Air Force
tanker en route from K.I . Sawyer crashed at Wurtsmith Air Force Base
near Oscoda . The Air Force 's investigation of the crash is
incomplete . Wurtsmith and Sawyer are Michigan 's two SAC bases .
A top West German military official
said Saturday that the fiery crash of a U.S. Air Force jet that
killed six people will further erode popular support for national
defense programs .
In the city of Remscheid , fire brigade leader Berthold Hoehler
said the body of a construction worker was pulled from the rubble of
a house destroyed in the accident , raisng the death toll from the
accident to six . Seven people hurt in Thursday 's accident remained
in critical condition , he said .
Later Saturday , at least 4,000 people took part in a torchlight
vigil and procession in downtown Remscheid to remember the victims
and to demand an end to low-level flight training missions .
A U.S. Air Force A-10 Thunderbolt II jet tore a swath of
destruction through a working-class neighborhood in the central West
German city of Remscheid . Rescue workers continued to comb the
debris Saturday , as work crews tore down the remains of demolished
houses .
In an interview with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper , the inspector
general of West Germany 's military said the crash was certain to
have a serious impact on already sinking public support for defense
issues .
`` We are in a very difficult psychological situation , '' Dieter
Wellershoff was quoted as saying .
Wellershoff was referring to recent polls indicating dwindling
public support for defense spending and increasing dissatisfaction
over disruptive and often deadly military training maneuvers .
`` I am alarmed that many West Germans have lost sight of the hard
facts ( of defense realities ) in their hopes for continued peace , ''
which hinge on West Germany 's and NATO 's security preparedness , he
said .
West Germany , a staunch NATO ally , borders East Germany and
Czechoslovakia , thus putting it on the front lines of the East-West
struggle .
Wellershoff 's comments were to appear in the newspaper 's Sunday
editions . The text of the interview was telexed in advance to other
news media .
West Germany 's skies are crowded with hundreds of jets and
helicopters each day . A series of deadly accidents has fueled
growing calls for a halt to or drastic reductions in low-level
training flights .
Even before Thursday 's fatal crash , 12 major accidents of
military aircraft had killed 95 people this year alone . They
included 70 people who died as a result of an air show crash at the
U.S. base in Ramstein in August .
Following the Remscheid crash , temporary suspensions of low-level
training missions were ordered .
The U.S. Air Force said in a statement Saturday that the pilot of
the A-10 `` inadvertently flew into clouds '' while attempting to join
in close formation with another aircraft .
The Air Force statement , quoting Maj. Gen. Marcus A. Anderson,
said the pilot `` then initiated a separation maneuver as is normal
if two aircraft in formation lose visual contact . ''
The statement said the lead aircraft climbed above the clouds,
but that the second A-10 `` continued in a descent . ''
`` We do not know why , '' Anderson said in the statement .
West German military officials have speculated that the pilot may
have become disoriented when he tried to climb out of the bad
weather .
Witnesses on the ground , however , have said they saw one of the
jet 's two engines on fire before it crashed .
A U.S. Air Force A-10 attack jet crashed and
burned in Britain this morning while on a routine training flight .
The Pentagon said the pilot might have ejected safely .
It was the second crash of a Thunderbolt jet in Europe in two
weeks . Another A-10 crashed Dec. 8 in Tracy , Ariz .
Dan Howard , the Pentagon 's chief spokesman , originally identified
the plane as an A-10 aircraft from the 81st Tactical Fighter Wing at
RAF Bentwaters , England . The Air Force later corrected that
statement , saying the A-10 was assigned to the 10th Tactical Fighter
Wing at RAF Alconbury .
Howard said the plane `` crashed at 9:53 a.m. EST about four miles
south of St. Ives , or about 25 miles north of Cambridge . ''
`` The pilot ejected and his chute was sighted but we do n't know
his status , '' Howard said .
The aircraft was carrying `` dummy bombs and practice 33mm
ammunition , '' the spokesman said .
He said he had no information about damage on the ground .
The A-10 , a twin-engine jet designed to support troops by killing
enemy tanks and other ground targets , is an older model plane
designed to be highly maneuverable at low speeds and low altitude
and to carry a lot of bombs and ammunition .
The Thunderbolt II is also one of the safest planes,
statistically , in the Air Force inventory .
Nonetheless , today 's crash comes just two weeks to the day after
another A-10 slammed into the West German city of Remscheid , killing
five and injuring dozens .
That crash prompted the United States and its NATO allies to
agree to suspend all A-10 flights over West Germany until Jan. 2 .
The suspension was ordered as German political parties and public
interest groups increased their demands for an end to low-level
flight training in Germany .
On the same day as the crash in Remscheid , an A-10 crashed near
the heart of the Tohono O'Odham Indian Reservation , about 80 miles
west of Tuscon , but the pilot ejected safely .
Howard refused today to discuss the possible cause of the crash
in England , saying the Pentagon was still awaiting initial reports
from the scene and confirmation that the pilot survived .
The Thunderbolt first flew in 1975 and became operational with
the Air Force in 1977 . The plane is no longer in production , but the
Air Force has more than 700 of them in its inventory .
Statistically , the A-10 over time has been the safest fighter or
attack plane currently in the inventory . The aircraft has chalked up
a major accident rate of less than 4 Class A mishaps per 100,000
flying hours over its lifetime _ which now consists of more than
1.75 million flight hours .
A Class A mishap is one in which there is either a fatality or
damage exceeding $ 500,000 to an aircraft .
The Air Force describes the A-10 as `` a simple , effective and
survivable twin-engine jet aircraft that can be used against all
ground targets ... The aircraft has excellent maneuverability at low
air speeds and altitude and highly accurate weapons delivery . ''
Nine reservists helping in the
U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf were among the 13 people
killed in the crash of U.S. military cargo plane in West Germany,
military authorities said Wednesday .
The crash early Wednesday of the huge C-5A transport was the
first major accident in the nearly 3-week-old , round-the-clock
deployment of U.S. personnel and equipment to the gulf .
`` I do n't want to speculate on the cause of this mishap , '' said
Brig . Gen. Richard Swope of the 316th Air Division . `` We do n't have
any indication as to what the cause of the accident was . ''
Four of the 17 people aboard the cargo plane were injured when
the massive aircraft tumbled into a field early Wednesday after
taking off from Ramstein Air Base , a stopover for many U.S .
military flights bound for the gulf region .
The plane was bound for Frankfurt carrying medical supplies,
food and aircraft maintenance equipment for U.S. troops sent to
Saudi Arabia following the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait , U.S .
Air Force officials said .
Late Wednesday , the Air Force released the names of the victims .
No hometowns were listed .
Nine of those killed and one of those injured were reservists
with the 433rd Military Airlift Wing from Kelly Air Force Base in
San Antonio . The four others were stationed at Ramstein or at
nearby Hahn Air Base .
Listed as dead from the 433rd were Maj. John M. Gordon , pilot ;
Maj. Richard W. Chase , pilot ; Sgt . Rosendo Herrera , flight
engineer ; Sgt . Carpio Villarreal , flight engineer ; Sgt . Daniel G .
Perez , loadmaster ; Sgt . Edward E. Sheffield , loadmaster ; Maj .
Richard M. Price , first pilot ; Sgt . Lonty A. Knutson , crew chief ;
and Sgt . Daniel Garza , crew chief .
Also killed were Capt . Bradley Schuldt and Sgt . Rande Hulec of
Ramstein and sergeants Samuel Gardner and Marc Cleyman of Hahn .
Listed as injured were Lt. Col. Frederick Arzt and Sgt . Dwight
Pettit , both of McChord Air Base in Washington state ; Capt . Cynthia
Borecky of England Air Base , Louisiana , and Sgt . Lorenzo Galvan Jr .
of the 433rd .
The four were hospitalized and reported in satisfactory
condition , said Sgt . Rourk Sheehan , spokesman for the Landstuhl
Army hospital nearby .
The 433rd had not been called to active duty , but some
reservists with the wing were voluntarily participating in
Operation Desert Shield after arranging time off from their
civilian jobs .
The plane was from the 60th Military Airlift Squadron from
Travis Air Force Base in California and was en route to Rhein-Mein
Air Base near Frankfurt , authorities said .
It left the Ramstein air base at about 12:30 a.m. and clipped
the tops of trees before crashing and breaking apart .
Twisted chunks of wings , landing gear , fuselage and other debris
were scattered over a wide area . Firefighters were still dousing
smoldering sections of wreckage 12 hours after the crash .
The weather was hazy but visibility was about one mile , said
Swope .
He said the aircraft was just over 20 years old , which he said
is not uncommon for the C-5 .
The accident occurred about six miles from Miesau , where U.S .
military authorities have been removing a cache of chemical weapons
under an agreement with the West German government .
The West German Defense Ministry said in a statement Wednesday
the crash posed no danger to the operation .
Ramstein , the largest U.S. Air Force base in Europe , is 90 miles
west of Frankfurt .
The C-5 is the largest transport plane in the Air Force fleet
and costs about $ 148 million .
It was the first crash of a C-5 in 15 years . On April 4 , 1975 , a
C-5B carrying Vietnamese orphans crashed shortly after takeoff near
Saigon , killing 172 people .
The crash Wednesday occurred a day after the second anniversary
of a collision during an air show at Ramstein which killed 70
people .
A U.S. Air Force F-111
fighter-bomber crashed today in Saudi Arabia , killing both crew
members , U.S. military officials reported .
It was the fourth American aircraft to crash in three days among
those deployed to this kingdom for Operation Desert Shield .
Eight Marines are missing in the crash of two helicopters in the
northern Arabian Sea on Monday . An Air Force F-4 reconnaissance jet
also went down that day , killing both crew members .
Lt. Cmdr . J.D . van Sickle , a military spokesman , said the F-111
crashed in the `` southern Arabian peninsula '' while on a training
mission and that the incident was under investigation .
The names of the flyers were withheld pending notification of
next of kin .
The aircraft was attached the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing based
at RAF Lakenheath Air Base in Britain . The wing was sent to Turkey
as U.S. forces massed in the region in response to Iraq 's Aug. 2
takeover of Kuwait .
Today 's crash brought to at least nine the number of Americans
killed in the Persian Gulf region since Operation Desert Shield
began .
The eight Marines aboard the two UH-1 Huey helicopters that
vanished Monday are still officially listed as missing .
In addition to those killed in Saudi Arabia , 13 other Air Force
personnel were killed in a crash of a C-5 jet cargo plane in
Germany . That aircraft was ferrying supplies and equipment to the
Saudi peninsula .
Officials said the F-111 crashed at dawn .
The aircraft was an F-model , the latest version of the
23-year-old swing-wing jet that first saw action in Vietnam .
The F-model has more powerful engines , and state-of-the-art
equipment to operate against enemy targets at night . The plane can
carry up to 12 tons of bombs and missiles and has a crew of two , a
pilot and a weapons systems officer .
U.S. Air Force war planes participating in
Operation Desert Shield are flying again after they were ordered
grounded for 24 hours following a rash of crashes .
Pentagon and Air Force officials said regular training flight
schedules resumed Thursday at noon local time ( 5 a.m. EDT ) . The
flights account for a majority of U.S. air missions in the Persian
Gulf region .
The Air Force `` has not changed anything '' in flight operations
as a result of the suspension of flights , Capt . A.C. Roper , a
spokesman for U.S. Central Command , said in Saudi Arabia .
He said Air Force officials wanted to `` examine potential
hazards and to be sure they were doing everything possible to
prevent accidents .
`` They have not identified any common cause or common
contributing factors '' to the recent accidents , he added .
At the Pentagon , spokesman Pete Williams said the number of U.S .
aircraft accidents in the gulf - including three separate crashes
this week - were not out of the ordinary . However , suspension of
training flights indicated otherwise .
Williams said the Air Force gave its pilots in the gulf `` safety
awareness '' briefings during the flight ban in order `` to review
what they need to do to fly more safely . ''
Aircraft on operational missions were not grounded , said Col .
Miguel Monteverde , another Pentagon spokesman . Those included
reconnaissance aircraft , refueling tanker planes and F-15 jets
patrolling areas near the Kuwait or Iraqi borders . He said pilots
of those planes received special safety briefings but their flight
schedules were not changed .
`` So there was no degradation of our ability to defend
ourselves , '' Monteverde said .
Desert Shield , the largest U.S. military buildup since the
Vietnam War , involves an estimated 700 Air Force combat and support
aircraft .
Williams said information about the number of flight hours in
Desert Shield is classified and will not be disclosed . As a result,
he said , he could not compare the accident rate with that of
previous deployments .
The toll for accidental deaths since Operation Desert Shield
began rose to 31 on Wednesday when an Air Force F-111
fighter-bomber crashed on a training mission in Saudi Arabia,
killing both crew members .
On Monday , two pilots were killed in the crash of an Air Force
F-4 Phantom reconnaissance jet in Saudi Arabia , and just hours
earlier two Marine Corps UH-1 Huey helicopters , each carrying four
crew members , crashed over the Arabian Sea , killing all eight men .
Williams said the Air Force was the only service that has taken
special measures to review safety in the gulf since this week 's
accidents .
`` They 're concerned about the accidents , they 're concerned about
the number of accidents that happened so quickly over a short
period of time , '' he told reporters .
He said , however , that the military 's safety record in Desert
Shield remained good .
`` Given the amount of flying that has to be done , given the
extraordinary circumstances and given the higher than ordinary
operating tempo in the area , I think our service people are doing
very well , but any accident is cause for concern , '' he said .
Five U.S. aircraft have been involved in fatal crashes in the
gulf area since the start of Desert Shield two months ago : an
F-111 , an F-4 Phantom reconnaissance jet , an F-15E and two Marine
Corps UH-1 Huey helicopters . Also , a C-5 transport plane crashed in
West Germany while ferrying equipment to Saudi Arabia .
Also , 20 other aircraft have been involved in non-fatal
accidents in the gulf area , Williams said . Fifteen of those were
helicopters .

[ Text ] Tokyo -- An F-15 fighter of the U.S . Forces on
Okinawa crashed near Kadena Air Base on 4 April . Commenting on
the crash , Akira Takeshita , deputy director general of the
Defense Facilities Administration Agency [ DFAA ] , said , `` Such a
crash should not have occurred and it is very regrettable that
the crash actually occurred . '' He also made it clear that
shortly after the crash , the DFAA asked the command of the U.S .
Forces in Japan [ USFJ ] to take thorough measures for safe
management of the U.S. military bases on Okinawa and conduct a
thorough investigation into the cause of the crash .
The Kadena Air Base public affairs office gave a briefing on
the crash and the DFAA released the briefing . The briefing said:
An F-15 fighter taking off from Kadena Air Base on a routine
training crashed near the air base at 0924 on 4 April . The
crashed aircraft belonged to the 44th Fighter Squadron of the
18th Wing and the pilot safely ejected from the aircraft without
injuries . A team will begin investigating the cause of the
crash and details of the accident will be made public once the
investigation is completed .
The U.S. military aircraft crashed about 800 meters
northeast
of a Kadena Air Base runway and the crash site is within the air
base 's facilities .
Mr. Takeshita said : `` As for the safe management of the U.S .
military bases on Okinawa , we have long asked the U.S. side for
it . The DFAA immediately expressed regret to the command of the
U.S . Forces in Yokota over the crash and the Naha DFAA Bureau
expressed regret to the commander of the U.S . Forces on Okinawa .
We will continue to ask them to work for the safe management of
the U.S. military bases in Japan . ''
