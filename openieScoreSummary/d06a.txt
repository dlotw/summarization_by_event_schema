In mid-June, a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department was settled when police agreed to stop using a martial-arts weapon, nunchakus, while arresting anti-abortion advocates.; So LAPD and other police forces around the country, including several in Orange  County and the San Diego Police Department, began using a modified martial arts  tool called a nunchaku -- now termed a "police control device" -- consisting of  two 12-inch lengths of plastic connected by a length of nylon. The Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the FBI are investigating  a videotaped incident in which a white Long Beach police officer appeared to  shove a black man's face into a plate glass window after a routine traffic  stop. LOS ANGELES Police Chief Daryl Gates had been accused of nurturing one of the most brutal police forces in the country: now he is under attack for fuelling the violence and then standing by as it rolled across poor black neighbourhoods. Jackson said he chose Long Beach police because of complaints to the Police Misconduct Lawyer's Referral Service of Los Angeles. Police booked Jackson for investigation of interfering with police and challenging a police officer.
