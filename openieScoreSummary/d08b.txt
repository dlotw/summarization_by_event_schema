Also, its 150-mile-wide path across Hawaii, Baja California, Mexico City and four Central American capital cities "puts more people in the moon's shadow than any other eclipse in history," says Alan Dyer, an editor of Astronomy magazine.; From Hawaii to Mexico to Central America, more than 40 million people saw the moon obscure so much of the sun that only a blazing ring was visible. Solar eclipses occur when the moon positions itself between the Earth and the sun. Solar telescopes yielded views of flare-producing sunspots and silhouetted mountains on the moon Tuesday as crowds gathered to watch a partial solar eclipse visible across western North America. The Bay Area gets cheated and will see the moon block only about half the sun's diameter.; The eclipse path reaches from Hawaii through Mexico to Brazil. More than a hundred sun gazers showed up at the Branham Lane Park in south San Jose with almost as many gizmos to help them spot sunspots and watch the moon cross the sun.; And in the Bay Area, more than half the sun was covered when the eclipse peaked at 11:20 a.m.
