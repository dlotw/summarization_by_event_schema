Also, its 150-mile-wide path across Hawaii, Baja California, Mexico City and four Central American capital cities "puts more people in the moon's shadow than any other eclipse in history," says Alan Dyer, an editor of Astronomy magazine.; From Hawaii to Mexico to Central America, more than 40 million people saw the moon obscure so much of the sun that only a blazing ring was visible. Solar telescopes yielded views of flare-producing sunspots and silhouetted mountains on the moon Tuesday as crowds gathered to watch a partial solar eclipse visible across western North America. Flights heavily booked;  Flights from here to Mexico and Hawaii -- where the eclipse can be seen in total -- were heavily booked by sunstruck people spending thousands of dollars to stand in 6 minutes, 53 seconds of darkness.; More than a hundred sun gazers showed up at the Branham Lane Park in south San Jose with almost as many gizmos to help them spot sunspots and watch the moon cross the sun.; In Helsinki, the total eclipse phase will occur 16 minutes after sunrise, when the sun is only 1 degree above the horizon.
