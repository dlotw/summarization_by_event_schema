In a blow to California and other states with large immigrant populations, the  Senate voted Friday to bar the Census Bureau from counting illegal aliens in  the 1990 population count. The Census Bureau's $4 billion budget for the census is large enough to identify and separate out the illegal aliens, he said. ``Every census since the Constitution was adopted has counted all residents of the states, including both legal and illegal aliens,'' added Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif. Just Thursday, efforts to include illegal aliens in the Census received a major  boost when negotiators from the U.S. Senate and House agreed on the issue. Census figures are used to redistribute the 435 House seats among the states every 10 years and to distribute federal aid to local governments. Before Thursday's action, the Senate had voted to bar the Census Bureau from  counting illegal aliens, although the House had twice rejected efforts to  exclude aliens. But the Senate already has voted to force the Census Bureau to exclude illegal immigrants in preparing tallies for congressional reapportionment. The Census Bureau agrees. Then again, the Census Bureau maintains that not including them, and still coming up with an accurate 1990 population count, would be even more difficult.
