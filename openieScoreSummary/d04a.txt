US insurers expect to pay out around Dollars 500m in claims as a result of damage caused by Hurricane Andrew in Louisiana, the American Insurance Services Group said yesterday, Nikki Tait reports. Although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in Florida on Monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of Lloyd's insurance market said yesterday. But on the Florida losses alone, Hurricane Andrew becomes the most costly insured catastrophe in the US. With Florida's Hurricane Andrew losses added in, the total rises to Dollars 11.2bn. The brunt of insurance claims from the Florida storm will fall on the US industry, and companies with a heavy local exposure include the State Farm Group and the Allstate Insurance unit of Sears Roebuck. The hurricane tore through southern Florida early on Monday morning, causing billions of dollars of property damage and at least 12 deaths, and yesterday was moving north-west across the Gulf of Mexico with winds of about 140 miles an hour. In Florida, Andrew caused greatest havoc in a largely suburban swathe some 10-15 miles south of Miami.
