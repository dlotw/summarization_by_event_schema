Tuberculosis is alarming health officials again because it's posing new health threats with its connection to the AIDS virus. The health department said it is providing tuberculosis testing and treatment for the Human Resources Administration's program for the homeless, and will train staff members on tuberculosis prevention and control. The study suggests that it lowers resistance to the tuberculosis bacteria, putting people at much higher risk of TB. A steady decline in tuberculosis has all but stopped amid the continuing threat of TB for the AIDS-infected, federal health researchers say. People may carry either the AIDS virus or tuberculosis bacteria for many years without getting sick. But the number of new cases is only part of the toll from tuberculosis, the CDC said. ``The aggressive identification and treatment of HIV-infected intravenous drug users with latent tuberculous infection is therefore of both clinical and public health importance,'' wrote Dr. Peter A. Selwyn of Montefiore Medical Center in New York. There are about 8 million new cases of tuberculosis a year, according to the  U.N. agency. In the United States, public health officials began to recognize about five  years ago that tuberculosis -- after steadily declining since the 1950s -- was  making a surprising comeback as a result of the AIDS epidemic.
