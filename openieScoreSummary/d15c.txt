Tuberculosis is alarming health officials again because it's posing new health threats with its connection to the AIDS virus. The health department said it is providing tuberculosis testing and treatment for the Human Resources Administration's program for the homeless, and will train staff members on tuberculosis prevention and control. ``The aggressive identification and treatment of HIV-infected intravenous drug users with latent tuberculous infection is therefore of both clinical and public health importance,'' wrote Dr. Peter A. Selwyn of Montefiore Medical Center in New York. A steady decline in tuberculosis has all but stopped amid the continuing threat of TB for the AIDS-infected, federal health researchers say. In the United States, public health officials began to recognize about five  years ago that tuberculosis -- after steadily declining since the 1950s -- was  making a surprising comeback as a result of the AIDS epidemic. But the number of new cases is only part of the toll from tuberculosis, the CDC said. "These new data have been stunning to everyone, because an awful lot of people  had thought that tuberculosis had gone away," said Dr. Barry Bloom, a professor  of microbiology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York and a  consultant to the United Nations.
